//! Soft delete helpers for SeaORM entities.
//!
//! Provides soft delete filtering for entities with a `deleted_at` column.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use scraper_service::helpers::soft_delete::{SoftDeletable, soft_delete_filter, SoftDeleteScope};
//! use sea_orm::*;
//!
//! // Query without deleted
//! let users = User::find()
//!     .filter(soft_delete_filter(user::Column::DeletedAt, SoftDeleteScope::WithoutDeleted))
//!     .all(db)
//!     .await?;
//!
//! // Query only deleted  
//! let deleted = User::find()
//!     .filter(soft_delete_filter(user::Column::DeletedAt, SoftDeleteScope::OnlyDeleted))
//!     .all(db)
//!     .await?;
//! ```
